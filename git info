It's a set of scripts he created for that workflow.

But to answer your question:

git checkout -b myFeature dev
```Creates the MyFeature branch off dev. Do your work and then```

git commit -am "Your message"
Now merge your changes to dev without a fast-forward

git checkout dev
git merge --no-ff myFeature
Now push the changes to the server

git push origin dev
git push origin myFeature
And you'll see it how you want it.
